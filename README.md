# WeatherCard App for HubSpot

WeatherCard is a private HubSpot CRM extension that displays real-time weather insights for contacts using a custom CRM card and a serverless backend integration.  

**User Story:**  
As a sales or support representative, I want to see the current weather for a contact's city directly in their CRM record, so I can personalize my outreach and build rapport.

**Rationale:**  
Weather is a universal topic and can be a great conversation starter. By surfacing local weather data in the CRM, reps can tailor their communication and create more engaging, relevant interactions with contacts.

## üîë Authentication Keys

- This extension requires an OpenWeatherMap API key to fetch weather data.
- The key is stored securely in the serverless function's `.env` file and referenced in [`serverless.json`](src/app/app.functions/serverless.json).
- Never commit your real API key to a public repository.
